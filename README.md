This repository contains

    'Topological_Kuramoto.py' a python code to for 
                                    i) Topological (Simplicial) Kuramoto model for edge signal (with an option for exposive variant);
                                    ii)Topological Dirac synchronization for nodes edges, traingles signals.

    'Topological_Kuramoto_Topological_Dirac_synchronization_notebook' a Python notebook for showing the dynamics in simple toy models.
